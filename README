                           Inventory-Rake-Tasks-YARD

  Inventory-Rake-Tasks-YARD provides Rake¹ tasks for YARD² using your
  Inventory³.

¹ See http://rake.rubyforge.org/
² See http://yardoc.org/
³ See http://disu.se/software/inventory/

§ Installation

    Install Inventory-Rake-Tasks-YARD with

    % gem install inventory-rake-tasks-yard

§ Usage

    Include the following code in your ‹Rakefile› (assuming that you’ve already
    set up Inventory-Rake¹:

      Inventory::Rake::Tasks.unless_installing_dependencies do
        require 'inventory-rake-tasks-yard-1.0'
        Inventory::Rake::Tasks::YARD.new
      end

    This’ll define the following tasks:

  = .yardopts (file). = Create .yardopts file; depends on the file defining
      this task and Rakefile.
  = html. = Generate documentation in HTML format for all lib files in the
      inventory; depends on .yardopts file.

    ‹Inventory::Rake::Tasks::YARD› takes a couple of options, but the ones you
    might want to adjust are

  = :options. = The options to pass to YARD; will be passed to
      `Shellwords.shelljoin`.
  = :globals. = The globals to pass to YARD.
  = :files. = The files to process; mainly used if you want to add additional
      files to process beyond the lib files in the inventory.

    The options passed to YARD will be augmented with any options you list in a
    file named ‹.yardopts.task›, where ‹task› is the name of the Rake task
    invoking YARD, for example, ‹.yardopts.html› for the default
    HTML-generating task.  You can use this to add options that are local to
    your installation and should thus not be listed in the Rakefile itself.

    See the {API documentation}² for more information.

§ Financing

    Currently, most of my time is spent at my day job and in my rather busy
    private life.  Please motivate me to spend time on this piece of software
    by donating some of your money to this project.  Yeah, I realize that
    requesting money to develop software is a bit, well, capitalistic of me.
    But please realize that I live in a capitalistic society and I need money
    to have other people give me the things that I need to continue living
    under the rules of said society.  So, if you feel that this piece of
    software has helped you out enough to warrant a reward, please PayPal a
    donation to now@disu.se¹.  Thanks!  Your support won’t go unnoticed!
